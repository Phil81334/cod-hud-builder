Tested with waw and bo1, works fine in both. 
Will do a cod4 test at some point when i re-install it.

-BO1 note:
  dont use 'UI_FONT_OBJECTIVE' as thats a waw specific font
  
-Elem note:
  I initially removed the Button elem as this tool is a hud builder, not a menu builder, but someone asked me to put it back in for them.
  You should only worry about using the Text/Material elems (unless you know what you're doing).

To Fix:
-text align not saving [Done ~ 29-04-23]
  will auto adjust until manually overridden
  
-account for when user uses colons on text elems [Done ~ 29-04-23]
  'Â¬' is a reserved program keyword now. if you wish to use it, then you need to do so in the generated file, not the program.
 
 -button elem arg indentation in generated file
