To Fix:
-text align not saving [Done ~ 29-04-23]
  will auto adjust until manually overridden
  
-account for when user uses colons on text elems [Done ~ 29-04-23]
  'Â¬' is a reserved program keyword now, so do not use it.

Updated:
-button elem args for: (action, mouseEnter, mouseExit), now go on seperate lines
  you need to seperate each arg via the '~' symbol
